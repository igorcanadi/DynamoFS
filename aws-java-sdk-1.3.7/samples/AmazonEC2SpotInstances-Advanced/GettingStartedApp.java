 * Welcome to your new AWS Java SDK based project!

 *
 * In order to use the services in this sample, you need:
 *
 *  - A valid Amazon Web Services account. You can register for AWS at:

 *
 *  - Your account's Access Key ID and Secret Access Key:
 *       http://aws.amazon.com/security-credentials
 *
 *  - A subscription to Amazon EC2. You can sign up for EC2 at:
 *       http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/
