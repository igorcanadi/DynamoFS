Linux Packages:
  python-sqlite
  python-sqlalchemy

Unfortunately, sqlite is not supported for Jython:
  http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.db.sqlite.user/300
Thus, to run the SQLite testcases, you will have to use plain-old Python.

A local installation of Jython (complete with SQLAlchemy) has been added to the repo,
so no further configuration should be necessary. If it is, instructions are given here:

  Jython:
    Version 2.5 or later is required.
  Notes:
    To install sqlalchemy with jython, follow instructions here:
      http://www.jython.org/jythonbook/en/1.0/DatabasesAndJython.html#sqlalchemy
    Make sure to install version 0.6.8, as described by the instructions.
